# Accelerator-powered Volume Slider (Bad UI Battle)

[Based on Caltrop's Physics Volume Ball](https://github.com/CaltropUwU/BadUI/tree/master/physicsVolumeBall)

The page uses accelerator input to control a volume slider. This requires a browser that supports the Accelerometer API.

Chrome for Android supports it, Firefox for Android does not.
